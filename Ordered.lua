-- Ordered Table
-- Written by Rici Lake. The author disclaims all rights and responsibilities,
-- and relinquishes the software below to the public domain.
-- Have fun with it.
--
-- The function Ordered creates a table which can iterate in order of its
-- entries. You'll need to modify pairs as indicated on the Lua wiki
-- (GeneralizedPairsAndIpairs) in order to use this feature.
--
-- Since stock Lua does not have constructors, you cannot "seed" the
-- table with an initializer. A patch for this is forthcoming; this function
-- was extracted from the tests for that patch.
--
-- The table does not allow deletion, so it might not be appropriate
-- for all cases. You can set a key to nil, which removes it from
-- the iteration, but the key is actually permanently in the table,
-- and setting it to a new value will restore it to its original place
-- in the table. Obviously, that's not ideal, but it was simple and
-- efficient, and it is always possible to compact a table by copying it.
--
-- Rather than use what seems to be the classic implementation, with
-- three tables: <key->ordinal, ordinal->key, ordinal->value>, we
-- use a regular key->value table, with an auxiliary linked list
-- key->nextkey.
-- 
-- The advantage of this setup is that we don't need to invoke a
-- metamethod for any case other than setting a new key (or a key
-- which has been previously set to nil), which is a significant
-- speed-up. It also makes it easy to implement the stability
-- guarantee. The disadvantage is that there is effectively a
-- memory-leak.
--
-- The table is fully stable; during an iteration, you can perform
-- an arbitrary modification (since keys are not ever actually deleted).

    -- nextkey and firstkey are used as markers; nextkey[firstkey] is
